HOW THE WONDROUS WEATHER CUBE WORKS

SIDE 1: Weather (Hot = red, Cold = blue -- have a scale)
SIDE 6: # of Emails (Green, blinks faster if you have more *important* emails)
SIDE 2: Twitter: emotion of tweets (Yellow -- the more positive emotions, the brighter) 
SIDE 5: A smiley face drawn on 
SIDE 3: Blank (rotation axis, maybe make it pretty somehow)
SIDE 4: Blank (rotation axis, maybe make it pretty somehow)

Distinguishes which side is which through the use of photosensors
